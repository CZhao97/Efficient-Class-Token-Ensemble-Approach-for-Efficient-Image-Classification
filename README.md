# Efficient Class Token Ensemble Approach for Efficient Image Classification

This repository contains the implementation of an innovative approach to efficient class token ensemble approach for efficient image classification. Our method combines the strengths of multiple pre-trained lightweight architectures with a class token-based transformer ensemble to achieve high accuracy efficiently.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of image classification tasks using an ensemble of lightweight models integrated with transformer architectures. By employing class tokens and focusing on computational efficiency, our approach is particularly well-suited for environments with limited computational resources.

## Features

- **Lightweight Models**: Utilizes pre-trained models like LCNet, MnasNet, and RepGhostNet.
- **Transformer Architecture**: Enhances the ensemble method with a transformer that processes class tokens derived from lightweight models.
- **Efficiency**: Designed for scenarios where computational resources are a constraint.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves competitive classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
